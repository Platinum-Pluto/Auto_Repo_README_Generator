# Code Repository Summarizer

## Project Title and Description

This project provides an automated and intelligent solution for summarizing code repositories using advanced Language Model Models (LLMs). Its primary goal is to simplify the process of understanding new or complex codebases by generating concise, insightful summaries. Whether you're onboarding to a new project, performing code reviews, or just need a quick overview, this tool streamlines the process of extracting the core essence of a repository. It's designed with modularity in mind, including a dedicated application for deployment on Hugging Face Spaces, leveraging Ollama for efficient local LLM inference.

## Features

*   **LLM-Powered Summarization**: Leverages state-of-the-art Language Model Models to deeply analyze and generate intelligent summaries of code repositories.
*   **Orchestrated Code Analysis**: Manages the entire pipeline from scanning a repository to processing its contents and synthesizing a comprehensive summary.
*   **Hugging Face Space Ready**: Includes a dedicated application (`HF_Space_Ollama/app.py`) designed for easy deployment and accessibility via Hugging Face Spaces.
*   **Ollama Integration**: Supports Ollama for running LLMs locally, providing flexibility and potentially reducing dependency on external cloud services for inference.
*   **Modular Design**: Clearly separates concerns, with core LLM interaction logic encapsulated for reusability and maintainability.
*   **Extensible**: Built with the flexibility to integrate different LLM providers or summarization strategies.

## Installation

To get this project up and running, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-repository-summarizer.git
    cd code-repository-summarizer
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install the necessary Python packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is assumed to exist in the root directory)*

4.  **Install Ollama (if planning to use local models)**:
    If you intend to use Ollama for local LLM inference, follow their official installation guide:
    [Ollama Download Page](https://ollama.com/download)
    After installation, pull the desired model, for example:
    ```bash
    ollama pull codellama
    # Or for a smaller model:
    # ollama pull phi3
    ```

## Usage

There are primarily two ways to use this repository summarizer: via the main orchestration script or through the Hugging Face Space application.

### 1. Summarizing a Repository (Local Execution)

The `main.py` script orchestrates the summarization process. You'll typically provide the path to the repository you want to summarize and an output file.

```bash
python main.py --repo_path /path/to/your/code/repository --output_file summary.md
```
*(Note: Command-line arguments like `--repo_path` and `--output_file` are inferred based on the project's purpose.)*

### 2. Running the Hugging Face Space Application (Local Development)

The `HF_Space_Ollama/app.py` script provides a web-based interface, likely built with Gradio or Streamlit, designed for Hugging Face Spaces. You can run it locally for testing or development.

1.  **Navigate to the HF Space directory**:
    ```bash
    cd HF_Space_Ollama
    ```
2.  **Ensure Ollama server is running**:
    Make sure your Ollama server is active and the required LLM model (e.g., `codellama`, `phi3`) is pulled and ready.
3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    This will typically launch a web interface accessible in your browser (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).
