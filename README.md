# LLM-Powered Code Summarizer

## Project Title and Description

This repository presents an **LLM-Powered Code Summarizer**, a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of understanding and documenting codebases. It orchestrates the collection, filtering, and summarization of code files within a specified directory using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary goal is to provide developers with quick, AI-generated insights into the functionality and purpose of their code, streamlining comprehension and documentation efforts.

## Features

*   **Automated Code Collection**: Scans a given directory to identify and gather relevant code files.
*   **Intelligent File Filtering**: (Inferred) Employs mechanisms to filter and prioritize code files for summarization, focusing on core logic.
*   **LLM-Driven Summarization**: Leverages the power of Large Language Models to generate concise and informative summaries of code content.
*   **Directory-Based Operation**: Processes entire codebases or specific subdirectories efficiently.
*   **Extensible LLM Integration**: Designed to work with various LLMs, potentially including local models (e.g., Ollama) and cloud-based services.

## Installation

To get started with the LLM-Powered Code Summarizer, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    While a `requirements.txt` file was not provided in the summaries, you would typically install necessary Python packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: You may need to install libraries for LLM interaction (e.g., `ollama`, `openai`, `transformers`) depending on the specific LLM integrations.*

4.  **Configure LLM Access**:
    Set up your LLM environment. This might involve:
    *   Setting API keys as environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
    *   Running a local LLM server (e.g., Ollama).
    *   Configuring specific model paths or endpoints.

## Usage

To use the code summarizer, run the `main.py` script, typically providing the path to the directory you wish to summarize.

```bash
python main.py /path/to/your/codebase
```

Replace `/path/to/your/codebase` with the actual path to the directory containing the code files you want to summarize. The script will then process the files and output their LLM-generated summaries.

## File Structure

```
.
├── main.py
├── llm.py
└── HF_Space_Ollama/
    └── app.py
```

*   **`main.py`**:
    This is the core orchestration script. Its primary purpose is to manage the end-to-end process: collecting code files from a specified directory, applying filtering logic, and then utilizing LLMs to generate summaries for these files.
*   **`llm.py`**:
    *(Based on name and project context)* This file is highly likely to encapsulate the logic for interacting with various Large Language Models. It would abstract away the specifics of different LLM APIs or local model interfaces, providing a clean way for `main.py` to request summarizations.
*   **`HF_Space_Ollama/app.py`**:
    *(Based on path and name)* This sub-directory and file suggest an integration designed for deployment on Hugging Face Spaces, potentially utilizing Ollama for local LLM inference. `app.py` would likely be the entry point for a web application or API served within the Hugging Face Space environment.
